# Montegomery's Diablo II Mod, Circa 2006-2010

Back in my freshman year of college I spent my free time modding Diablo II instead of putting my Computer Science studies to more productive use. This mod, which I resurrected from my old blueberry iMac, has been updated to work with version 1.14 of Diablo II.

The purpose of the mod was simple, I was sick of my characters getting automatically deleted by Battle.net but was also annoyed by the difficulty of getting the items I wanted in single player. Unfortunately all existing mods that might have helped me utterly trivialized the game. Thus this mod was born.

Eventually the scope expanded somewhat. I modified a few of the weaker skills to be stronger or less situational, expanded the scope of gambling, added some unique and set items of my own, and a few other flourishes. Eventually I may catalogue them here.

For now I'm posting the mod solely as txt files, and anyone truly interested can discern the indiscretions, idioscyncracies, and hypocrisies of my youth by comparing the difference between them and their original versions (helpfully checked in first to provide an easy diff opportunity).

# Windows Installation

1. Copy monted2mod's data folder to your Diablo II directory.
2. Create a shortcut pointing to the Game.exe application.
3. Right click the shortcut and select Properties.
4. Modify the target, adding the following text outside of the quotation marks: -direct -txt
5. Use the shortcut to play the game, you're done!
